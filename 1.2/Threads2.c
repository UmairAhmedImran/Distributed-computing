/*
    Why Does This Happen?

This is due to a race condition. A race condition occurs when multiple threads access and modify a shared variable concurrently without proper synchronization, leading to unpredictable results.
Whatâ€™s Happening Under the Hood?

    The operation counter = counter + 1 is not atomic. It involves three steps:

        Read the current value of counter.

        Increment the value by 1.

        Write the new value back to counter.

    When two threads run simultaneously, they may interleave these steps. For example:

        Thread A reads counter = 100.

        Thread B reads counter = 100.

        Thread A increments and writes counter = 101.

        Thread B increments and writes counter = 101.

        The final value is 101, even though two increments were performed.

    This interleaving happens millions of times, causing the final value of counter to be much lower than expected.main: begin (counter = 0)
